Know Bugs
=========
1. Sometimes, the filepath for a file is different from the actual file path hierarchy file path displayed in the App.
2. Two files of the same name causes a lot of problems. (deleting files of the same name deletes all files of the same name in each folder)
3. Cannot undo multiple stages, because we haven't implemented a stack for storing actions that has been done to the expandable list view.

Did not Finish
